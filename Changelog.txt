Changelog

v1.1 (version number not finalized)

Updated to work with EU4 version 1.XXXXX

ADDITIONS:
Added Holy Site CBs.
[[[Added Holy Site Bonuses mechanic via events. Now if you hold a Holy Site you get events where you can choose between 5 bonuses.]]]
Added Personal Deities to some pagan religions (Credit to qweytr of Extended Timeline).
 - Hellenic
 - Romuva
 - Slavic
 - Soumenusko
Added "Open/Close Religious Debate" decisions to show/hide the "Convert to [Religion]" decisions, so as to not clutter up the decisions interface. (Thanks for the suggestion Ilija)
Added 3 Hussite Holy Sites (Not yet implemented a decision to convert yet, also need events to get to 5 as to be in line with everything else.)

UPDATES:
Updated convert to religion decisions to have a cooldown timer of 10 years (subject to change, feedback welcome), so as to not allow switching through religions immediately after you've already switched.
Updated convert to religion decisions to not allow defenders of the faith to convert to another religion.
Updated Mayan religion holy site province from "2633 Mani" to "2651 Ah Canul" (to separate it from Chichen Itza).
Updated Shinto religion holy site province from "1029 Kai" to "1839 Suruga", to be inline with the updated localisations and descriptions.
Updated Shinto religion holy site province modifiers localisations with better shrine names and short descriptions.
Updated all province modifier pictures.
Updated holy site conversion zeal country modifier to include missionary maintenance cost reduction.
Updated all province triggered modifiers (Holy Site province modifiers variable name) so that they don't use province id's in their naming, but instead use holy site name or province name (ex. changed from 0118 to rome), this is more of a backend thing.
Updated Hellenic, Romuva and Slavic to the new provinces introduced with Emperor.
Updated religion icons with the newly added religions of Hussite and Dreamtime.

BUGS & FIXES:
Fixed holy site conversion zeal country modifier by adding 'religion = yes' so that it gets removed if you change religions. Done so you can't use my mod to get the modifier bonus and immediately change back to your previous religion using vanilla game or other mods that allow you to change religion.
Fixed a bug in 01_converted_rebel_types where if you gave into the demands of Soumenusko rebels, they would force convert you to 'animism' instead of the correct 'finnish_pagan_reformed' religion.
Fixed a visual "bug" where if your capital was a holy site, the tooltip for accepting decision would show the province twice being converted.
